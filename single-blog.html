						<p>There are many possibilities in the Holyspirit that we can explore not just for ministry and that which pertains to life and Godliness 

							If at all, it is your destiny /purpose you want to fulfil, the Holyspirit is that personality, because the power you need to do that is found in Him... There's no time for us to look at why we need power to prosecute our destiny... But just know that, no man is enough to fulfil a quarter of his destiny all by himself, the world is too wicked to be that kind... The earlier we come to that conclusion the faster we'll go in destiny.... 
							So don't forget, it is the Holyspirit that regulates your possibilities as a believer.. And the deaignated proof that you have the Holyspirit in you is POWER, yes speaking in tongues is an evidence that you are filled with the Holy ghost but the proof of the Holyspirit in you is that you receive Power.  
							Meanwhile, that you receive power is not enough that the power is manifested, I don't want to bring plenty stories into this so we just keep it simple, but then know that, the fact that you receive power doesn't mean that you're operating it, because there are modus operandi... 
							For example, you are hungry, somone gives you a loaf of bread, you have it in your hand and you are staring at it, does that satisfy the hunger in you??? No.. Until you put it in your mouth and you eat.... 
							So now that  we understand that the power of God is responsible for bringing into reality the possibility of God in our lives, how do we activate and make use of it??? </p>
						
							<blockquote>There are many possibilities to explore in the Holyspirit to the degree of our yieldingness.</blockquote>

						<h3>What do we do activate the power of God?</h3>
						<p>
							I'll just limit this to two points cos of our time and in no particular order
							<p>
							1. 
							Power is only given to Him that will fulfil its purpose. 
							The reason why God gives us Power is simple, as Jesus said, to be a witness unto Him... If the reason you why you ask God to empower you is for the prosecution of His will in your life, then you Wil have it... The first thing that disqualies a man from accessing the resources of God is the impurity of his motive... Why do you need the power of God in your life??? There are many scriptures I would have loved us to consider on this particular point, but time is really a constraint... Brothers and sisters, the best thing you can ever do to yourself, is to make a decision to serve the will of God..... Alot of people have missed it because they thought serving the will of God means to become an evangelist, in as much that is a possibility, that's not fundamental, serving the will OF God is to yield the totality of your life and whatever that's yours to serve the vision of Jesus.... Not everybody is called to be a pastor, or Apostle, but everyone is called to serve the will of God.. Not everyone is called to be a preacher but everyone is called to be a witness... The difference is simple, it takes knowledge to be a preacher, but it takes power to be a witness... It you want to walk in the power of God, you must be willing to be a witness unto Him, you must be willing to serve His will.... This covers your entire life, your purpose may be  in the government of nations, you need the power of God to fulfil that purpose, and unless you will be a witness unto Him, you can't access that power, Heaven does not releases resources on projects that are not sanctioned by God....okay let's just check one scripture on this
							
							Luke 11:34
							[34]The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.  
						</p>
							<p>
							Your body can only be full of light when your eye is single, hmm, oh God time will still not permit me to talk on this passage, but this passage is far from being ordinary, the subject here is not really your physical eyes... Although it's still applicable but the essence of this passage is that, if your eyes (I. E your gaze, your will, especially your desire) is single, the word single here is not related to number or count, because if you read further you will see that the opposite of single in this passage is not double, the opposite is EVIL, and if you want to get an accurate understanding of this, you should check Matthew 7 :9 - 12 later on, your eyes is single if your gaze is fixed on God, of your desire is found in the desire of the father, this only when your body will be full of light(this phrase is another thing entirely but lets not digress too much) 
							Just remember, the first thing that denies a man access into the resources of God, is the impurity of his motive... 
												
						</p>
							
							<p>
							2. Submission to the pursuit of God. 
							From the passage in Acts 10...you'd see that Jesus succeeded in His doin because God was with Him.... In as much as you are given power when the spirit comes into you, it's the Holyspirit that operates the power in you, God will never give you something that you don't need him to operate... God will never give you something that will make you independent of Him...so the extent of the power of God that will manifest in you or through your life is to the degree of your yieldingness... The measure of your submission to the government of the Holyspirit is the measure of power that comes out of you. .. So if you want to   see the power of God in your academics, yield it to God... I tell you today, and I've said this before, I gave up on my academics in my 200 level, I mean I gave it to God, I was never controlled by it anymore, and till I graduated my academics was only secondary.. And that's why I was able to see God at work in it. If it's your business, submit it to God and tell God it will serve His purpose and see God at work, 
							If your future is still a subject of fear, it's an indication that you have not let it go, because you will see the power of God in whatever you give into the service of His will... Submission is key.... Whatsoever you exalt to be above God becomes an enemy of God... Whatsoever you exalt to contest with God in your heart will not prosper, because no one fights with God and succeed... If you want to seethe power of God in that aspect of your life, release it to serve the will of God..... 
							
							Okay let me quickly addd one more so we stop at three
							
							This point would have been better explained in physical but let me just use a simple term
						</p>

						<p>
							3. Prayer and Fasting 
							Ermmm.... It's a bit hard for me to explain what I have in mind while typing this... 
							Okay let's look at Mark 9:28-29
							[28]And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
							[29]And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
							Prayer and fasting grants you access to the power of God in you... From my little experience and understanding, if you really want to see the power of God, you can't boycott prayer and fasting..., if I will go into this, we will look at alot of scriptures, but Ermmm, prayer and fasting a system by which believers express priesthood....infact if you will see the power of God perpetually, I belive you life must become an expression of prayer and fasting...
							Maybe some other time, we may be able to talk on prayer and fasting together because I don't want to start what I won't finish now... You know a refinery is used to process crude oil, the same way, prayer and fasting helps to facilitate the processing of God's power in the life of a believer...
						</p>
							I leave you with this as well, if you want to manifest the power of God in your life, (note I'm not talking about ministry, it's just life), practise the habit of prayer without ceasing.... Practise the life of fasting, practise the life of total submission to the will of God....</p>
